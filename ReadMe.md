## Installation

To get started with the Cancer Prediction App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sheris-Milly/Cancer_Predection_App.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Cancer_Predection_App
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   Start the Flask backend:

   ```bash
   cd server
   python app.py
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

   ## Docker Setup

To run the application using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t breast-cancer-prediction-app .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 breast-cancer-prediction-app
    ```


## Usage

1. **Enter Patient Data:** Fill in the form with the required patient details.
2. **Get Prediction:** Click on the "Predict" button to receive the prediction results.
3. **View Results:** The application will display the prediction and any relevant visualizations.

## How It Works

The Cancer Prediction App utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical patient data. The model analyzes input features to provide a prediction of breast cancer risk. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection:** Historical data is collected and preprocessed.
2. **Model Training:** The data is used to train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
3. **Prediction:** User input is fed into the trained model to generate a prediction.

## Model Training

If you are interested in how the machine learning model is trained, refer to the `model.py` script in the directory. The model is evaluated and optimized using techniques like GridSearchCV  to ensure accuracy.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Cancer Prediction App! If you have suggestions or improvements, please follow these steps:
